# UT Boot Camp Portfolio Webpage Mock Up

## Objective

Creat a first draft of a portfolio webpage that can be updated as I learn more in the boot camp. Also to apply specific elements to help with diffrent screen sizes and have areas to show case current and future projects. Needed to have variable colors, and all link working properly. 

## Application
All of the clickable areas of the webpage either go to the designated section of the webpage, or if needed openes external links to show work. Any projects clicked on will send you to the github pages extension of the code. If anything in there I dont have any examples of yet I it will send you to a "Coming Soon" page.
